|**8**|**Incident Analysis and Resolution** |**It was the time of night when this incident happened, our main electricity supply of the house caught fire and got damaged which lead to power outrage in whole house.We had very less quantity of water left in the tank and due to electricity faliure we were'nt able to switch on the motor.Therefore we had to call up the electrician for repairing the power supply, he told us that he can't do much because it was very dark and he could'nt do the work efficiently. We asked him to atleast repair the motor and some part of the connection which were mandatory for us in order to do our chores.He, then inserted the negative and positive wires which were earlier in  the MCB into another board and passed the current directly via the board into the motor, which finally powered up the motor.** |
